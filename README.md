# Twitter Block

Chrome extension to add a single click block icon to Twitter web UI.

Andy Baio [idly asked on twitter](https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/539854793435394049) for someone to implement this feature so I used it as an opportunity to learn a bit about web programming.

## Installation

Download the `twitter-block.crx` file and drag/drop it into your Chrome extensions tab. Detailed instructions here: https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769

## TODO:
